# Policy Upsert Upgrade Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the new policy upsert functionality that has been added to the 24hourservice-Backend system. The upgrade introduces a new boolean field `shouldUpsertPolicies` to the Organization model, modifies the policy uploading process to support batch upserts, and includes comprehensive email notification system.

## Features

### 1. Organization Model Enhancement

- **New Field**: `shouldUpsertPolicies` (Boolean, default: false)
- **Purpose**: Controls whether an organization uses upsert mode for policy uploads
- **Location**: `src/models/organization.model.js`

### 2. Enhanced Policy Upload Process

The system now supports two modes for policy uploads:

#### Individual Mode (Default)
- Validates each policy individually
- Checks for duplicates before insertion
- Slower but safer for incremental updates
- Used when `shouldUpsertPolicies = false`

#### Upsert Mode (New)
- Deletes all existing policies for the organization
- Batch inserts new policies in chunks of 1000
- Significantly faster for large datasets
- Used when `shouldUpsertPolicies = true`

### 3. Email Notification System (New)

The system now includes comprehensive email notifications for policy upload processing:

#### Features:
- **Upload Started Notifications**: Sent when bulk upload begins
- **Upload Completion Notifications**: Sent when processing completes
- **Detailed Results**: Includes success/failure statistics and error details
- **Beautiful HTML Templates**: Professional email design with company branding
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to organization owner's email if user email unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of email failures without affecting upload process

#### Email Templates:
- **Started Email**: Confirms upload has begun with job details
- **Success Email**: Celebrates successful completion with statistics
- **Partial Success Email**: Shows mixed results with failed policy details
- **Failure Email**: Reports complete failure with error information

## Usage Examples

### Enable Upsert for Organization

```javascript
const organizationService = require('../services/organization.service');

// Enable upsert mode
await organizationService.setShouldUpsertPolicies('org_id', true);

// Check current setting
const isEnabled = await organizationService.getShouldUpsertPolicies('org_id');
console.log('Upsert enabled:', isEnabled);
```

### Bulk Enable for Multiple Organizations

```javascript
const orgIds = ['org1', 'org2', 'org3'];
const result = await organizationService.bulkSetShouldUpsertPolicies(orgIds, true);
console.log(`Updated ${result.modifiedCount} organizations`);
```

### Upload Policies with Upsert and Email Notifications

```javascript
// The upload process automatically detects the organization's setting
const policies = [/* policy data */];
const result = await bulkUploadPolicies(
  policies, 
  adminRole, 
  userId, 
  organizationId, 
  jobId, 
  true // sendNotifications
);

console.log(`Mode: ${result.mode}`); // "upsert" or "individual"

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Organizations

All existing organizations have `shouldUpsertPolicies = false` by default, ensuring backward compatibility.

### Enabling Upsert Mode

1. **Single Organization:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT /api/v1/organizations/{org_id}/upsert-policies \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"shouldUpsert": true}'
   ```

2. **Multiple Organizations:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT /api/v1/organizations/bulk/upsert-policies \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"organizationIds": ["org1", "org2"], "shouldUpsert": true}'
   ```

### Email Configuration Setup

1. **Configure SMTP Settings**: Update environment variables
2. **Test Email Configuration**: Use the test endpoint
3. **Verify Email Templates**: Check logo path and branding
4. **Monitor Email Delivery**: Check logs for email sending status

## Best Practices

### When to Use Upsert Mode

✅ **Recommended for:**
- Large policy datasets (>1000 policies)
- Complete policy refreshes
- Data migrations
- Bulk updates from external systems

❌ **Not recommended for:**
- Small incremental updates
- When preserving existing data is critical
- Organizations with complex policy relationships

### Email Notification Best Practices

✅ **Recommended:**
- Always enable notifications for large uploads
- Test email configuration before production use
- Monitor email delivery logs
- Provide clear support contact information

❌ **Avoid:**
- Sending notifications for very small uploads (< 10 policies)
- Using personal email addresses for system notifications
- Ignoring email delivery failures

### Safety Considerations

1. **Backup Data**: Always backup before enabling upsert mode
2. **Test First**: Use test environment before production
3. **Monitor Jobs**: Watch background job progress
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Enable for a few organizations first
5. **Email Testing**: Verify email configuration works properly

## Error Handling

### Batch Processing Errors

The system handles errors gracefully:
- Individual batch failures don't stop the entire process
- Detailed error reporting for failed policies
- Partial success tracking
- **New**: Email notifications include error details

### Email Notification Errors

The system handles email failures gracefully:
- Email failures don't affect upload processing
- Detailed logging of email sending attempts
- Fallback to organization owner's email
- Graceful degradation when email service unavailable

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Invalid Policy Data**: Logged and skipped, reported in email
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Retry mechanism, email notification sent
3. **Memory Constraints**: Chunked processing prevents issues
4. **Email Service Down**: Upload continues, email failure logged

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Messages

The system provides detailed logging:
```
🔄 Starting bulk upload of 2500 policies for organization org_123
📋 Organization upsert mode: ENABLED
📧 Start notification email sent to user@example.com
🗑️ Deleting all existing policies for organization org_123
✅ Deleted 1500 existing policies
📦 Batch inserting 2500 policies in chunks of 1000
📋 Processing batch 1/3 (1000 policies)
✅ Successfully inserted batch 1/3 (1000 policies)
📊 Bulk upload completed: 2500/2500 policies uploaded successfully (Mode: UPSERT) in 2.5 minutes
📧 Completion notification email sent to user@example.com
```

### Email Monitoring

Monitor email delivery:
```
📧 Upload started notification sent to user@example.com
