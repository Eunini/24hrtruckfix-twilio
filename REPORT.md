    'user_location': 'miami_fl',
    'search_timestamp': '2025-10-03T12:34:56'
  });
  ```

- **Custom Dimensions**:
  - Service type (towing, battery, repair, etc.)
  - User geography
  - Device/browser information
  - Referring channel

### Benefits
- Understand user drop-off points in the conversion funnel
- Optimize high-friction areas in the booking process
- Target marketing efforts to high-value segments

## 2. Twilio Analytics Dashboard

### Recommendation
Create a comprehensive Twilio analytics dashboard to monitor call performance, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction.

### Implementation Details
- **Call Metrics to Track**:
  - Total call volume (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Average call duration
  - First-call resolution rate
  - Call abandonment rate
  - Peak call times

- **SMS Metrics**:
  - Delivery rate
  - Response rate
  - Time to first response
  - Conversion rate from SMS to booking

- **Integration Requirements**:
  ```javascript
  // Example code to track call duration and outcome
  const callAnalytics = {
    callSid: call.sid,
    duration: call.duration,
    fromNumber: call.from,
    toNumber: call.to,
    outcome: 'completed', // or 'abandoned', 'transferred', etc.
    firstTimeCustomer: isNewCustomer,
    serviceRequested: serviceType
  };
  
  // Store in database for analytics
  await CallAnalytics.create(callAnalytics);
  ```

### Benefits
- Identify communication bottlenecks
- Optimize agent scheduling based on call volume patterns
- Improve response times and customer satisfaction

## 3. Stripe Payment Funnel Analysis

### Recommendation
Implement detailed tracking of the payment funnel to identify drop-offs and optimize conversion.

### Implementation Details
- **Payment Stages to Track**:
  - Checkout initiated

  - Payment success/failure
  - Subscription creation/renewal

- **Key Metrics**:
  - Conversion rate at each stage
  - Average transaction value
  - Payment method distribution
  - Failure reasons (categorized)
  - Retry success rate

- **Dashboard Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  // Track payment stage transitions
  const trackPaymentStage = async (userId, ticketId, stage, metadata = {}) => {
    await PaymentAnalytics.create({
      userId,
      ticketId,
      stage,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      metadata
    });
  };
  ```

### Benefits
